### Arrays

1. Largest Element in an Array:

		//Given:
		int[] a1 = { 10, 5, 20, 10 };
		//Expected: 20

2. Second Largest Element in an Array:

		//Given:
		int[] a2 = { 15, 5, 20, 12, 14, 20, 8 };
		// Expected: 10

3. Check if array is sorted or not (Ascending)

		// Given:
		int[] a3 = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 };
		// Expected: true
		//Given:
		int[] a4 = { 1,8,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 };
		// Expected: false

4. Reverse an Array:

		// Given:
		int[] a5 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
		// Expected: [5,4,3,2,1]

5. Remove duplicates from sorted array

		//Given:
		int[] a6 = {10,20,20,30,30,30};
		//Expected: [10,20,30]

6. Move zeros to the end

	   //Given
	   int[] a7 = {1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 0,  9, 0};		
	   //Expected: [1,2,3,5,9,0,0,0,0]

7. Left rotate array by d places

		// Given:
		int[] a8 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
		int d = 2;
		// Expected: [3,4,5,2,1]

8. Leaders in an Array problem

  		What is a Leader? 
		An element is a leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. 
		
		Given Input: arr[] = {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, 
		Expected Output: 17, 5, 2

9. Maximum Difference Problem with Order

		Given an array arr[] of integers, find out the maximum difference between any two elements such that the larger element appears after the smaller number. 
		
		Input : arr = {2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1}
		Output : 8
		Explanation : The maximum difference is between 10 and 2.
		
		Input : arr = {7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2}
		Output : 2
		Explanation : The maximum difference is between 9 and 7.

10.  Find the Frequencies in a Sorted Array

		Given a sorted array, arr[] consisting of N integers, the task is to find the frequencies of each array element.
		Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10} 
		Output:       Frequency of 1 is: 3
		              Frequency of 2 is: 1
		              Frequency of 3 is: 2
		              Frequency of 5 is: 2
		              Frequency of 8 is: 3
		              Frequency of 9 is: 2
		              Frequency of 10 is: 1
		Input: arr[] = {2, 2, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 11} 
		Output:        Frequency of 2 is: 2
		               Frequency of 6 is: 2
		               Frequency of 7 is: 3
		               Frequency of 11 is: 1

# Hashing

1. Count Distinct Elements.

			In this particular problem, we are presented with an array of integers, and our objective is to determine the number of unique elements within the array. To accomplish this, we will explore two distinct approaches: a Naive approach utilizing nested loops, and an Efficient solution employing Hashing (Sets).
			
			// Given:
			int[] a1 = { 15, 12, 13, 12, 13, 13, 18 };
			
			// Expected: 4

2. Frequencies of array elements.

			// In this particular problem, we are presented with an array of integers, and
			// our objective is to determine the frequency of the array elements ie. the
			// number of times each element occurs in the array. To accomplish this, we will
			// explore two distinct approaches: a Naive approach utilizing nested loops, and
			// an Efficient solution employing Hashing (Maps).
			
			// Given:
			int[] a2 = { 10, 12, 10, 15, 10, 20, 12, 12 };
			// Expected:
			// 10: 3
			// 12: 3
			// 15: 1
			// 20: 1

3. Intersection of two unsorted arrays.

			In this particular problem, we are presented with an array of unique integers, and our objective is to find the intersection of the arrays and print the elements according to the order of occurrence in the first array. To accomplish this, we will explore two distinct approaches: a Naive approach utilizing nested loops, and an Efficient solution employing Hashing .
			
			// Given:
			int[] a3 = { 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50 };
			int[] aa3 = { 30, 5, 15, 80 };
			// Expected: 15,30
